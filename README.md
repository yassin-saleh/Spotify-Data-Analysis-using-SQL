## Overview
This project involves analyzing a Spotify dataset with various attributes about tracks, albums, and artists using **SQL**. It covers an end-to-end process of normalizing a denormalized dataset, performing SQL queries of varying complexity (easy, medium, and advanced), and optimizing query performance. The primary goals of the project are to practice advanced SQL skills and generate valuable insights from the dataset.


## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, it’s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

### 4. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into **easy**, **medium**, and **advanced** levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

#### Easy Queries
- Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
  
#### Medium Queries
- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation and functions
  
#### Advanced Queries
- Nested subqueries, window functions, and CTEs

## 15 Practice Questions

### Easy Level
1. Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.
2. List all albums along with their respective artists.
3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where `licensed = TRUE`.
4. Find all tracks that belong to the album type `single`.
5. Count the total number of tracks by each artist.

### Medium Level
1. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
2. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
3. List all tracks along with their views and likes where `official_video = TRUE`.
4. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
5. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.

### Advanced Level
1. Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
2. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
3. **Use a `WITH` clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.**
4. Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2.
5. Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions.
